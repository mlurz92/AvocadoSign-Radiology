# Radiology: Publication Instructions for Authors - Original Research Articles

Published regularly since 1923, *Radiology* is the premier source for peer-reviewed original research, authoritative reviews, well-balanced commentary on important articles, and expert opinion on new techniques and technologies in the field.

This document outlines the essential guidelines and detailed requirements for authors submitting Original Research Articles to *Radiology*. All submissions must adhere to a double-anonymized peer-review process and are in accord with the “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals” of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/).

## General Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All manuscripts and letters must be submitted online through the *Radiology* submission and peer-review website hosted by ScholarOne at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rad. Submission is free.
*   **Peer Review:** *Radiology* uses a double-anonymized peer-review process.
*   **Trainee First Author:** Research articles in which the first author is a trainee (i.e., resident or fellow in diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, or radiation oncology) will be promoted via *Radiology* In Training. The trainee status of the first author should be stated in the Cover Letter.
*   **ORCID iD:** The submitting author of the manuscript will be required to link his or her ScholarOne account to an ORCID iD (http://www.orcid.org/). All other authors of accepted manuscripts will also be required to link their accounts.
*   **Plagiarism:** *Radiology* uses the word check program iThenticate (http://www.ithenticate.com/) to assess for potential overlap in prior publication. Authors must attest that a manuscript on the same or similar material has not already been published by them, and has not been and will not be submitted to another journal by them or by colleagues at their institution before their work appears in *Radiology*. Problematic manuscripts will be returned without peer review.
*   **English Language Editing:** Authors who feel their manuscript would benefit from professional English language editing support are encouraged to seek such services. This is not a requirement and does not guarantee acceptance.

## Manuscript Type: Original Research

These articles provide new knowledge based on original research. Meta-analyses are also acceptable/encouraged in this category. Studies should be hypothesis-driven (for prospective studies) and have well-described methods that can effectively answer the question addressed. These articles require appropriate statistical analyses. If your clinical trial has an assigned number, please provide. Possible registries include ClinicalTrials.gov or WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

*   **Word count:** no more than 3000 words (Introduction to Discussion)
*   **Abstract:** Structured and no more than 300 words
*   **Reference Limit:** 35 (limit may be extended for meta-analyses)
*   **Figure Limit (images, charts, or graphs):** 6
*   **Table Limit:** 4
*   **Key Results:** Include up to 3 main results/conclusions from your study (maximum: 75 words) including summary data. Do NOT repeat your summary statement. Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts. Please avoid using vague language and abbreviations in the Key Results. Obvious abbreviations like CT and MRI are fine.
    *   *Example (modified from /doi/10.1148/radiol.2021203051):*
        *   In a retrospective review of 222 patients with cirrhosis, 63% had a spontaneous portosystemic shunt (SPSS) on CT, 28% of which had a diameter of at least 1 cm.
        *   Portal vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; *P* = .008) and Child-Pugh class C (OR, 3.0; *P* = .03) were associated with SPSSs of any size.
        *   Previous hepatic encephalopathy (OR, 4.4; *P* = .001) and portal vein thrombosis (OR, 5.3; *P* = .002) were associated with an SPSS of at least 1 cm.
*   **Required Summary Statement:** 1 sentence summarizing the important findings of your manuscript (maximum: 30 words). Tip: If title includes a modality and disease, then so should summary.
*   **Demographics Table:** For manuscripts with human study participants, include a table of participant demographics/characteristics. This should be Table 1 of your paper. Minimum information should include number and sex of participants, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) or median age and interquartile range (IQR) and key clinical characteristics.
*   **Flow Diagram:** Include a diagram (figure 1 of your paper) showing initial number of participants and those excluded for any reason. Document the number excluded for each reason.
*   **Applicable Checklist:** Required as appropriate for studies involving human patients.
*   **Race and Ethnicity Reporting:** If race and ethnicity categories were collected, include the source of the classifications used (e.g., self-report or selection, investigator observed, database, electronic health record, survey) and why assessed (e.g., if required by a funding agency). In the results section, report specific participant race and ethnicity categories instead of collective terms like “other.” Categories should be listed in alphabetical order in text and tables. For tables, a footnote defining the categories of “other” would be sufficient. For additional information, see ["Updated Guidance on Reporting Race and Ethnicity in Medical and Science Journals."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783090)

## Author Resources

*   **Research Best Practices and Ethics:** The EQUATOR Network (http://www.equator-network.org/) “works to improve the reliability and value of medical research literature by promoting transparent and accurate reporting of research studies.” Visit their website for a compendium of information on research best practices and publication ethics.
*   **Statistical Analyses:** For details of common statistical analyses performed by radiologists, please see our collection of *Radiology* articles on statistics and data analysis. For a list of the top ten most common errors encountered in submission to the journal, see our editorial “Submissions to *Radiology*: Our Top 10 List of Statistical Errors” (Radiology 2009; 253:288–290). *Radiology* recommends that authors seek statistical consultation before planning a study to ensure appropriate enrollment and collection of data and the use of statistical tools.
*   **Clinical Trial Registration and Data Sharing:** Please see /page/policies#clinical for clinical trial and data sharing requirements. For further explanation, see the following article: /doi/10.1148/radiol.2021211967.
*   **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Patient confidentiality must be protected. No patient names, hospital ID numbers, or any other information that allows the patient to be identified should appear in images or illustrations, including in the original image file names. Crop all images to remove identifying information prior to importing them into your manuscript or presentation. If a “black bar” or other visual aid is used to obscure PHI in Photoshop, image layers must be “flattened” to remove the information from the image metadata. Images cropped within PowerPoint should be flattened with the Compress Pictures tool.

## Manuscript Preparation

### Writing a Research Manuscript

*   **Use of Previously Published Material:** Provide appropriate attribution for the source of any previously published material. Even if this material is from publications in your own group, it must be quoted and referenced. Written permission from the publisher (and the author when applicable) is required to reproduce any previously published figures and tables. Any such material must be clearly noted and its source given in the manuscript.

### Manuscript Organization and Content

For your convenience, please use the Manuscript Preparation Checklist and Scientific Style Guide to ensure you have met all of our guidelines prior to submitting your paper. Any missing items may prevent your paper from being sent out for peer review.

*Radiology* manuscripts undergo scientific editing during the peer review stage.

    *   Figure Legends (only, no figures)
    *   Tables (embedded, one per page)

### Authorship

*   *Radiology* does not allow multiple corresponding authors. Each manuscript can only have two first authors and two senior authors. For articles with a large list of authors (e.g., >30), a group byline will be recommended with the individual names of each author listed at the end of the article. All authors names will still be individually indexed, displaced, and easily searchable in bibliographic records such as PubMed.
*   **Industry Support:** In instances of financial support of an author’s study by industry, information should be included at the beginning of the Materials and Methods section of the text. Authors should indicate (a) the name of the industry providing support for the study, (b) the type of support (financial, provision of equipment or contrast agents, etc), and (c) that the authors had control of the data and information submitted for publication. For authors who are employees of or consultants to the industry providing support, it must be clearly stated that the nonemployee or nonconsultant authors had control of the data and information that might present a conflict of interest for the other employee or consultant authors. Statements regarding control of data and information are also needed for any authors who are employees of or consultants to an industry whose products are being evaluated in the study, even if the industry did not support the study.
*   **Conflicts of Interest:** Any other nonfinancial conflicts of interest should also be disclosed to the Editor, with the understanding that the information may be published if deemed appropriate by the Editor. Authors will be asked to complete an ICMJE conflict of interest disclosure form before the final acceptance of the manuscript.

### Text Formatting and Style

*   **Format:** Text should be submitted as Office 2010 (or later) Microsoft Word format.
*   **Layout:** Double space all text with adequate margins and do not right justify.
*   **Font:** Use basic fonts such as Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman at 11 points.
*   **Special Characters:** Create special or mathematical characters and Greek letters using the symbol font. Embed equations where cited in text.
*   **Page Numbers:** Do not number the pages of the manuscript. They will be automatically numbered during the conversion to PDF format.
*   **Language:** Avoid laboratory slang and clinical jargon. Consider your audience. Confirm your text is clear to a radiologist not in your specialty.
*   **Self-evaluation:** Avoid self-evaluation of your work, for example, “novel,” “unique,” “ground-breaking.”
*   **Self-references (Anonymized Review):** Avoid self-references due to anonymized review: “In our prior study… (ref XX)” should be, “Prior studies have shown…“ [reference].

### Units/Abbreviations

*   **Units:** Use the International System of Units (SI) for radiation measurements and laboratory values.
*   **Abbreviations:** Spell out abbreviations when first used in the abstract and text—for example, “cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).” Obvious abbreviations like MRI, CT, PET, US do not need to be spelled out.
*   **Limit:** A maximum of 10 abbreviations are allowed. An abbreviation should only be used if the term appears at least five times in your manuscript (Introduction to Discussion). Otherwise, write them out and do not include them in the list.
*   **Avoid:** Avoid nonstandard terms or abbreviations. Do not abbreviate adjusted values (aOR; adjusted odds ratio). Instead write “In the adjusted model, the OR was XX; after multivariable adjustment, the OR was XX.”
*   **Specific Sections:** Define all abbreviations used in figures and tables in the legend. Do not use abbreviations in the Summary Statement, Key Results, abstract conclusion, and first and last paragraph of discussion. Readers often look to those areas first for a synopsis.

### Double-Anonymized Requirements

*   The Abbreviated Title Page must be anonymized.
*   Do not self-identify your prior work. For example, do not state “as we have previously described,” [author’s reference]. Instead, suitable language would be, “Prior studies have shown…“ [reference].
*   Do not mention the author(s)’ institution or funding information in the manuscript.
*   Anonymize the author(s)’ initials if they are readers.
*   **Do not anonymize:** Clinical trial names and registration numbers (e.g., NCT number on clincialtrials.gov), study name (“The MESA study…” “The ADVANCE registry…”), IRB numbers (Do not include your institution name.), software names, References – *No references should be deleted*.

### Cover Letter

Prepare a separate cover letter for your submission. Your cover letter should include:

*   Title of the manuscript.
*   Complete author list.
*   For manuscripts with two first authors, submit a brief statement of explanation for why equal author contribution is warranted (REQUIRED).
*   State whether or not the first author is a trainee, i.e. resident or fellow in diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine or radiation oncology (REQUIRED for Original Research).
*   Description of any subject overlap with previously published works (REQUIRED). Your subject overlap statement should include prior published studies as well as work currently undergoing review or in press at a journal where subjects overlap with the current manuscript. Subject overlap means that the patients, animals, or experiments have been previously reported. Explain what is new and different about your current analysis. EXAMPLE: “In a prior study, we reported on 50 patients included in the current study. The prior report evaluated tumor response. The current study expands on this by having a larger patient number and includes new analyses of survival.” During the submission process, include PDFs of articles where the subject overlap occurred. Please note that subject overlap should also be reported in the Materials and Methods section of your paper.
*   Description of any conflict of interest or industry support of the project (REQUIRED).
*   Confirmation of sole submission to *Radiology* (REQUIRED).
*   Explanation of circumstances if authors are requesting fast-track and/or dual first authorship.
*   The RSNA provides social media coverage of journal articles. If you or any of your co-authors have Twitter or Facebook accounts, please provide those handles. Alternatively, you may provide social media handles used by your department or institution.

### Full Title Page

Prepare a separate Full Title Page for your submission. Your Full Title Page should include:

*   The title of the manuscript (15 words).
*   The first and last names, middle initials, academic degrees, and institutions of all authors.
*   The name and street address of the institution from which the work originated.
*   The telephone number, e-mail address, and complete address (name, street address, postal or zip code) of the corresponding author.

*   Article Type.
*   A summary statement (for Original Research papers) of no more than 30 words in **boldface**. This should be a single sentence that highlights the key finding in your study.
*   Key Results, consisting of up to 3 main results/conclusions from your study (maximum: 75 words) including summary data. Do NOT repeat your summary statement. Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts. Please avoid using vague language and abbreviations in the Key Results. Obvious abbreviations like CT and MRI are fine. Type “N/A” if your study has none.
*   List of all abbreviations with spelled out words (no more than 10).

### Abstract (Structured: Original Research)

Original Research manuscripts must include a structured abstract of 300 words or less divided into five sections.

*   **Background:** Include 1-2 sentences stating why your study was performed and/or why it is relevant. Try to frame your background statement from a clinical radiologist's perspective (e.g., Why is this study important to my radiology practice?).
*   **Purpose:** In one to two sentences, succinctly state the study purpose. Describe the question you are trying to answer. This should be a brief but precise statement that is essentially the same as your aim at the end of your introduction. Your Purpose determines the direction of your entire study.
*   **Materials and Methods:**
    *   Identify as prospective or retrospective.
        *   **Prospective study:** Data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed. Enrollment of participants with consent, data analysis, and outcomes were specified prior to initiating the study.
        *   **Secondary analysis of prospective trial:** If main prospective study did not include your study purpose in original design, classify as a secondary analysis of a prospective trial.
        *   **Retrospective study:** Looks backwards and examines exposures to suspected risk or protection factors related to an outcome established at start of the study.
    *   Date range of study (e.g., July 2019 to June 2020). Recent dates are preferred. Clearly state the length of any follow-up period(s).
    *   If animal study, provide number and type of animals. For humans, number/sex ratios/ages go in results.
    *   Specify disease, groups compared (eg, women with and without breast cancer).
    *   For registered studies, provide registry name and number (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567).
    *   Reference standard is usually the best test currently available and the standard against which the index test is compared. It should be clear what each of these are.
    *   Describe modalities/procedures performed.
    *   Describe pre-specified primary outcome measure(s), as well as secondary and other variables, interventions being compared, treatment group, control group.
    *   Include one sentence on statistical analyses, such as tests performed. Key statistical terms like multivariable, adjusted, or independent/control variables will make your study stand out.
*   **Results:**
    *   The first sentence should indicate the number, sex, and mean age ± standard deviation or median age and interquartile range (whole numbers only) of the study participants enrolled. For example, if there are 100 patients of 60 men and 40 women, then write *100 patients (mean age, 47 years +/- 10 [standard deviation]; 60 men)* were evaluated. Provide sex of the larger number of patients.
    *   Then, provide the findings in parallel with the Methods and include indicators of statistical significance, actual numbers, and percentages.
    *   Report the numerator and denominator for all percentages (e.g., sensitivity 20 of 25 (80%)).
    *   All p-values need corresponding comparison values (e.g., group A, 25 ± 4, group B 50 ± 5, p=.01).
    *   Include confidence intervals when appropriate (e.g., AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
    *   Focus on about three main results. Make it readable. Provide numerical data and P values for all comparisons but try to have a balance of text and numbers. The results should be interpretable on their own without reference to your paper. Provide the labels and units for your numbers.
*   **Conclusion:** Must derive directly from the results. Do not elaborate on the significance or other implications of your study. Must address the purpose of the study.

### Main Body (Original Research)

Original Research articles use the following headings: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion. Authors may want to add subheadings to the Materials and Methods and Results sections for clarity purposes.

*   **Introduction:**
    *   No more than 400 words.
    *   Typically contains background information and references that inform the reader as to why the study was performed. No extensive literature review. Brevity and focus are important.
    *   **Claims of Priority:** If you must indicate novelty, use the phrase “the finding of [whatever the finding is] has not previously been well established in the literature.” If discussing study size, do not refer to your study as “the largest study to date,” instead write, “large studies have not yet been performed on [whatever topic].” Only state these claims once in the introduction.
    *   **Hypothesis:** In the final paragraph, state the hypothesis (for prospective studies only) and purpose. Your purpose should be essentially the same as in the abstract. Do not provide a hypothesis for retrospective studies, meta-analysis/systematic reviews, or technical development papers.

*   **Materials and Methods:**
    *   No more than 800 words. Include all items presented in the Results section.
    *   **First Paragraph (Regulatory Approvals):** Address in the first paragraph (1) Institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient informed consent (state if consent was obtained); (2) HIPAA compliance for U.S. studies; (3) Clinical Trials Registry Number and Registry Name. State if study is retrospective or prospective. For animal experiments, provide a statement of approval by the institutional animal care committee or appropriate substitute. At the editor’s discretion, we may request a copy/verification of IRB/institutional review approval of your study prior to acceptance.
    *   **AI or AI-assisted technologies:** At submission, indicate if you have used any AI or AI-assisted technologies in your manuscript preparation. Report how they were used, providing name and version of the AI tool, date of access, and name of the manufacturer or creator. This information can be in Materials and Methods, Acknowledgments, or relevant figure legends.
    *   **Subheadings:** Use appropriate subheadings (e.g., Participants, Imaging Protocol, Image Analysis, Statistical analysis).
    *   **Eligibility (Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria):** Describe inclusion and exclusion criteria, consecutive or random selection. Indicate how sample size was derived. This should match study flowchart (typically figure 1).
    *   **Who, Where, When, What:**
        *   **Who you studied:** Mention your sampling technique (nonprobability sampling: consecutive, convenience; or random sampling). Indicate whether matched or paired samples.
        *   **Where your study took place:** Mention if your study was a single-center or multicenter study. Specify the type of institution (e.g., tertiary care center, academic medical center, community hospital). If multicenter, mention how many institutions were involved. Blind institution(s) name at first submission.
        *   **When your study took place:** Provide the start and end dates (month and year) of data collection or participant accrual (e.g., Patients underwent CT between July 2022 and June 2023).
        *   **What you analyzed:** Describe prespecified primary and secondary outcome measure(s), other variables analyzed, and interventions compared (treatment vs control group).
    *   **Overlap:** Mention whether all or part of your patient population was previously reported with citation of the appropriate reference(s). Explain if there was a different analysis of data. If too many to reference, make an online appendix.
    *   **Definitions of Terms:** Consider including a separate section titled *Definitions of Terms* for key terms. Move any long equations to the supplement.
    *   **Imaging Protocols:** For MRI, include enough detail that the imaging could be repeated for the key sequences, such as repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). For CT, indicate contrast or non-contrast, plane, section thickness, and section interval. More detail can be in a supplement.
    *   **Product Name and Manufacturer:** When first mentioned, identify any utilized instruments or drugs (including contrast) with brand/trade names and manufacturer’s name in parentheses. Thereafter, use generic terms. If multiple brands of systems are used, a table is suggested.
    *   **Investigators:** Provide expertise and years of experience of the individual(s) performing important portions of study (i.e., index tests, readings). If authors, then also provide initials. If mentioning authors more than once, you only need to list expertise once. Identify how investigators were anonymized.
    *   **Subgroup analysis:** Mention if subgroup analysis was pre-specified (required for randomized controlled clinical trials) or post-hoc. If post hoc analysis, address in methods and include as a limitation in discussion.
    *   **Readers/Evaluations:**
        *   Provide number, training/expertise, and years of experience for persons executing and reading index tests. For resident readings, indicate “in-training.”
        *   Indicate if studies were read independently, if readings randomly assigned, if consensus agreements were used, and how disagreements were handled between readers. Single observer studies are discouraged, as are “consensus” reads.
        *   Mention anonymizing of data or images. State what readers anonymized to, not anonymized to.
        *   Provide time interval between readout sessions to eliminate recall bias.
        *   For one/multiple readers, indicate how intra- or inter-reader variability was measured (e.g., $\kappa$ statistic, intraclass correlation coefficient) and how coefficients were interpreted.
    *   **Statistical Analysis (Last Paragraph):** State the statistical methods used to analyze the data. Mention the statistical software used, along with version and manufacturer's name. State the p-value used for significance. If statistical analyst is an author, then provide initials. A statement of justification of sample size and/ or power calculation is strongly recommended. Avoid net reclassification index and integrated discrimination index to make inferences regarding a new radiology imaging test being better than an old test. Traditional AUC analysis or change in standard metrics (e.g., test positivity rate) is sufficient. AUC is preferred to C-index.
    *   **Registered Studies and Data Sharing Statement:** If your study is registered on or is a secondary analysis of a study registered on a national or international database (for example: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform), then provide registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567) both at the end of the Abstract, and again in Materials & Methods. Include one of the following statements verbatim on the full title page:
        *   Data generated by the authors or analyzed during the study are available at: (author provides citation to data).
        *   Data analyzed during the study were provided by a third party. Requests for data should be directed to the provider indicated in the Acknowledgments.
        *   Data generated or analyzed during the study are available from the corresponding author by request.
        *   All data generated or analyzed during the study are included in the published paper.
        *   No data were generated or analyzed during the study.
    *   **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Articles:**
        *   **Describe all Datasets and Include a Dataset Characteristics Table and Flowchart:** Each dataset should be independent, without overlap.
            1.  **Training set:** The initial dataset used to train your AI model according to a reference standard. Typically, this should be your largest dataset.
            2.  **Validation set:** The subset of data held-out from your training set to tune or optimize your model (i.e., fine-tuning hyperparameters) before testing.
            3.  **Internal test set:** The subset of data held-out from your training data and used for testing.
            4.  **External test set:** A completely external dataset (i.e., images from another institution) used for final statistical reporting of your model’s performance.
        *   **Computer Code (Required for Publication):** Deposit all computer code in a publicly accessible repository such as Github: https://github.com/, BitBucket: www.bitbucket.org/, or SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/. In materials and methods, provide a link to this code.
    *   **Systematic Review and/or Meta-Analysis Papers:** Specify databases searched and exact search terms used. Indicate why records were excluded from your study. Include a flow diagram as Figure 1 in your results, showing initial number of records identified through database searching and those excluded for any reason. Document the number excluded for each reason.

*   **Results:**
    *   No more than 1000 words.
    *   **First Paragraph (Demographics):** Summarize the demographics of your study sample. At a minimum, indicate number of patients/participants, mean age ± standard deviation or median age and interquartile range, and number of men vs women. For manuscripts with human study participants, include a table of demographics/characteristics (Table 1). The first paragraph of Results should summarize and cite Table 1 demographics. Also, document the number of participants excluded for each exclusion criteria described in methods. Include a flow diagram as Figure 1 and cite in the Results, showing initial number of participants and those excluded for any reason.
    *   Present the results in logical sequence in the text, along with tables and illustrations. Summarize important observations with reference to appropriate tables and figures. Give results for all items mentioned in the Materials and Methods. Use Materials and Methods subheadings in the same sequence in the Results, as appropriate.
    *   State the statistical significance of the findings. Report the results of the statistical analyses for all variables collected and analyzed, not just for those which exhibited statistical or near statistical significance. Avoid hedge terms such as “trend” or “marginal” for results that are not statistically significant.
    *   Provide numerators and denominators for all percentages, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.
    *   Regression coefficients or mean values of compared groups must be given along with p-values for all comparisons (e.g., group A, 25 ± 4, group B 50 ± 5, p=.01).
    *   **P-value Formatting:** P-values should be expressed to 2 digits to the right of the decimal point (regardless of whether the p-value is significant) unless p <.01 in which case the p-value should be expressed to 3 digits to the right of the decimal point. The exception to this rule is when rounding p from 3 digits to 2 digits would result in p appearing non-significant (such as p=.046). Give exact p-value unless <.001. The smallest p-value that should be expressed is <.001. The largest p-value is >.99. Do not include leading zeros for P values. Avoid scientific notation (e.g., p = 5×10-3 should be p=.005; p = 5×10-5 should be p<.001).
    *   Include confidence intervals when appropriate (e.g., AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
    *   **Avoid overuse of the term *significant***: Use *significant* only in the statistical sense. Delete unless referring to something being *clinically significant* or having *clinical significance*. Then use that exact wording.
    *   **Wording of nonsignificant results:** Do not write “There was no difference between groups A and B.” Write “We found no evidence of a difference between groups A and B.”

*   **Discussion:**
    *   No more than 800 words. Do not repeat in detail the data given in the Results section. Do not cite tables or figures in the discussion. These should be introduced in the Materials and Methods and Results sections.
    *   **First Paragraph (Summary):** Briefly restate the problem that you studied and the primary results. Provide a succinct one paragraph summary of your entire study: briefly restate the background for your study and why it was done. Then state your major findings. Instead of providing general statements that something was generally better or superior, provide specific metrics (key results) and p-values that support your statements.
    *   Subsequently, briefly review what others have reported and why your findings are better/confirmatory/different in 2-4 paragraphs. If multiple prior studies on the topic, consider including a small summary table of prior results in the literature, rather than making the reader search for all prior articles.
    *   Include implications of the findings and their limitations, in particular with reference to the use of modified methods, statistical or otherwise. Relate the observations to other relevant studies. Link the conclusions with the goals of the study, but avoid unqualified statements and conclusions not supported completely by the data. Avoid claiming priority and alluding to or giving the results of ongoing investigations that have not been completed or that are not part of the study. State new hypotheses when warranted, but clearly label them as such.
    *   **Limitations (Second to Last Paragraph):** Address study limitations, such as sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalizability. If using a post hoc analysis, include it as a limitation.
    *   **Conclusion (Final Paragraph):** Summarize your results and findings; if appropriate, offer what you think should be done in the future to advance your study. If an animal study, then discuss practical applications.

### Supplemental Materials

*   **Submission:** Authors may provide supplemental material to give readers additional information about the work. This material can include (1) multimedia (such as animation, dynamic image sets [movies], audio); (2) large numbers of relevant images whose number would exceed the limits of the article PDF; (3) relevant data in the form of tables or text that could not be accommodated in the article PDF; (4) interactive materials such as Java applets and other programs for expanding browser capabilities and interactivity in areas such as image display and computer-assisted instruction; (5) algorithms; (6) Jupyter notebooks; and (7) annotated image sets. To be considered for publication, supplemental material must be submitted electronically through our manuscript submission system along with the main article.
*   **Preparation:** Supplemental text, tables, and figures (with legends) should be compiled in one Word document, separate from the main body manuscript file, and uploaded as a “Supplemental File for Review.” Movies and audio should be uploaded separately and labeled as “Multimedia.” Permission letters required for any of the supplemental material must also be uploaded.
*   **Note:** Supplemental Material is not copyedited. Authors are responsible for the accuracy and presentation of the content. *Radiology* encourages authors to post raw data/spreadsheets online. Please be sure your data is anonymized.

### Tables

*   Prepare tables in Microsoft Word and attach them to the end of the text document.
*   Each table should be on a separate page and have a short, descriptive title.
*   Each table should be limited to no more than 40 rows and 6-8 columns.
*   Number each table in Arabic numerals. Each table should be cited in numeric order in the main text.
*   When indicating values such as sensitivity, specificity, provide these as X/Y (%); give the numerator and denominator.
*   Supply information on statistical variability when applicable (e.g., standard deviations for mean values or confidence intervals etc as appropriate).
*   Tables must be understandable by themselves without reference to the results section.
*   Do not use the merged cell feature of Word. Use subheadings instead.
*   Every column must have a heading. Each column must follow the same heading all the way down.
*   Each row must follow the same heading all the way across.
*   Tables must have more than one row. If there is no need for more than one row in a table, the information in that table should instead be incorporated into the text.
*   The same data should be presented consistently (e.g., to the same number of significant digits) throughout the abstract, text, tables, figures, and supplements.
*   Each item of data should be contained within its own cell.
*   Use rows for independent (x) variables; use columns for dependent (y) variables.
*   All abbreviations used in tables need to be defined in the footnotes of each table.
*   **Table 1: Demographic Characteristics of Study Sample:** For manuscripts with human participants, include a table of demographic characteristics. Minimum information should include number and sex of participants, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) or median age interquartile range (IQR), age range, and key clinical characteristics. Provide relevant covariates needed to describe participants (e.g., women: pre/postmenopausal status; cardiovascular disease: diabetes status, smoking.). IF biologically reasonable and a large study, provide mean age ± standard deviation (SD) or median age and interquartile range (IQR) separately for men and women, in addition to giving the same information for all individuals as one group. Also, report any statistically significant differences in age between the men and women.
*   **Multivariable analysis tables:** Include key parameters: regression coefficients, odds or hazard ratios with confidence intervals, and p-values. Include the number of events (n = __).

### Figure Legends

*   For new submissions, figure legends should appear directly after the relevant figure in the combined figure text document. For revised manuscripts, all figure legends should appear collectively at the end of the main document.
*   Include appropriate figure legends for all figures, including drawings and graphs.
*   All abbreviations used in figures and figure legends need to be defined in the figure legend. Do not duplicate text material.
*   For images of human subjects, the legend must include the age, sex, and clinical history/disease of the patient, if relevant to the figure.
*   For studies on animals, the legend must include the type of animal (and age, weight, and/or diagnosis, if appropriate).
*   The legend must describe all labels placed on an illustration.
*   The legend must include the type of image, its plane, whether or not contrast material was used, the pulse sequence information for MR images (in general, full details of the MR sequences should be given in the methods not in the legend), and the features to be observed by the reader.
*   For photomicrographs, include the stain and original magnification. Use scale markers where appropriate.
*   For drawings and graphs, the legend must state the important points to be observed.

### Figures

*   **For Original Submissions:** For new submissions, figures should be combined into one Word document in the order they appear in the text, with figure legends immediately following the relevant figure. Crop figures to area of interest. Allow enough surrounding area for assessment of pertinent anatomic information. Number figures (figure 1, figure 2) and include no more than four components (a, b, c, d) for each figure. Multipart figures should be combined to appear on the same page. Label all features described in the figure legend. Use different labels for each feature. Exclude patient and subject identifying information. Use same magnification for multiple images of a given type (for example, CT, MR, US) or view. Use the tonal relations of the original radiograph. Limit to required figures showing essential features described in the manuscript. Do not include redundant or excessive figures. Include separate figures for individual patients. Figure legends should include age, sex, clinical history/disease, imaging modality, plane, and other relevant details such as whether contrast was used or not. Use present tense.
    *   *Example:* Image in a 65-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit. Unenhanced axial chest CT image shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities (arrows) with random distribution and peripheral bandlike consolidation in the right lower lobe (arrowhead), with visual quantification of the well-aerated lung of 35%. (Adapted from /doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020201433)
*   **Enhancements:** If a figure has been enhanced electronically, explain the alterations made and send an original image along with the enhanced one.
*   Additional figures may be submitted as supplemental material.
*   *Radiology* discourages the use of previously published figures unless absolutely essential.
*   Figure arrays are done by RSNA professional artists’ service, provided to *Radiology* authors without charge.
*   **Collages:** *Radiology* accepts figures grouped as a collage if the relationship requires arrows/tags to convey meaning. For original submissions, combine parts so they appear on one page for review. For revised submissions, upload each part separately, with the following parameters: Use Photoshop and keep all layers when creating the TIF file. Resolution: minimum of 300 dpi if substantial text/labeling. Size: 3 inches for each image. Labels: san-serif font, such as Arial, bold, point size 12 or larger.
*   **For Revised Manuscripts:** For revisions, production quality figures should be uploaded individually, not in a combined document. Number and label figures consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the manuscript. Ensure that the file name contains the figure number. (e.g., Figure 1.tif; Figure 2a.tif, Figure 3.eps) When uploading image files into Manuscript Central/ScholarOne, please insert the figure legend into the caption box. Begin each caption with the word “Figure” followed by the figure number and figure part, if applicable. (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2a). If figures are multi-part, submit each figure part as a separate figure file and enter a separate legend/citation for each part (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2A, Figure 2B).
*   **Photographic/halftone image scans (grayscale or color):** Formats: PSD (Photoshop), TIF, AI, and EPS, unflattened vector files. PNG files are not accepted. Resolution: 300 dpi. Size: minimum of 3 inches to a maximum of 7 inches. Labels/arrows: professional quality placed on a separate layer of the image file (do not merge or flatten), and must touch edge of the feature being labeled (do not use equilateral triangles for arrowheads). Do *not* send as Word or PowerPoint document.
*   **Graphs/Illustrations:** Graphs, illustrations, and drawings rendered in professional graphics programs should be submitted in Photoshop (.psd), TIFF (.tif), Powerpoint (.ppt), AI (.ai), or encapsulated Postscript (.eps) format at 1200 dpi. Layers should be retained (do not "flatten" the image), and image should not be upsampled. If the graph or illustration was created in Excel or Word, we recommend that you submit the original file in the native format.
*   **Using Color in Images:** While RSNA encourages the use of color keys in your images, graphs, and illustrations please use the Colorblindness Accessibility Guide to choose a color palette when possible. The color palettes should be considered when using color to differentiate data in graphs, or when several colored keys are used in an image. Radiologic/pathologic images do not need to be altered. You can also place your images in the Color Blindness Simulator (Coblis) to see if your colors will be easily discernable.
*   **Kaplan Meier curves:** Add the censored data points and the number at risk below the graph.
*   **Box Plunger Plots:** Avoid box plunger plots. Present data as a box whisker plot or show actual data points in box plot.
*   **Provide Clinical Images:** Provide at least one or two actual scan images that demonstrate your main findings.

### Checklist (STARD, CONSORT, PRISMA, or STROBE)

Upon initial submission of Original Research papers that involve human subjects, you will be required to choose the checklist that is applicable to your study from the list below. Checklists are not required for animal studies. It may be that not all checklist items are appropriate for a study, in which case you should mark the item “not applicable.” Note: Your paper will be sent back if this checklist is not included upon first submission.

1.  For studies dealing with diagnostic accuracy, use the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (**STARD**) (Radiology 2015; doi:10.1148/radiol.2015151516).
2.  For randomized controlled trials, use the **CONSORT** (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement (BMJ 2010; 340).
3.  For systemic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies, follow the **PRISMA-DTA** (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews-Diagnostic Test Accuracy) guidelines (/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2018180850).
4.  For observational studies, such as cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies, use the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (**STROBE**) guidelines.

Use of checklists allows authors to describe their work more effectively, aiding the detailed scientific review of their work and its key results and implications for future biomedical research. This critical evaluation also aids authors in the discussion of the limitations and biases inherent in their study. (Radiology 2016;278:6–10)

### Common Issues and Terminology

*   **Terminology:**
    *   For Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, abbreviate as AUC and not AUROC.
    *   Avoid overuse of the term *biomarker*.
    *   Change density (for CT) to *attenuation*.
    *   Change multivariate/univariate to *multivariable/univariable*. A multivariable regression equation has multiple x variables and a single y (dependent) variable. If multiple Y variables in one equation, then multivariate may be (rarely) appropriate.
    *   **Limit the term *Cases***: Do not use *cases* when you could use a more specific word *(patients, participants, lesions)*.
    *   **Define all terms at first use:** For example, “Conventional” and “high resolution” MRI are vague. Be specific. Conventional compared to what? High spatial resolution or high temporal resolution? There is no standard accepted definition of “high resolution” MRI or CT. Terms such as Ultra high resolution/Low dose/Ultra low dose should be used sparingly and defined in Methods.
    *   **Provide correlation coefficient if using term *Correlated***: Use “correlated” only in the statistical sense and provide correlation coefficient. Otherwise use another appropriate word (associated, compared).
    *   **Study sample vs study cohort vs population:** Study sample is a subset of the population. Population is the wide-ranging group of people to whom you aim to generalize the study results. Study cohort is only appropriate for a longitudinal study that samples and observes a cohort over a period of time.
*   **Incomplete Reporting of Results:** Always report p-values with corresponding comparison values (group A, 25 ± 4, group B 50 ± 5, p=.01). Provide both numerical data and p-values for all comparisons.
*   **Accuracy vs Performance:** These terms are often confused. AUC measures the performance of a model. So, for AUC you would refer to diagnostic performance instead of diagnostic accuracy. Refer to accuracy when referring to accuracy percentage (fraction of predictions model got right).

### How to Present Numbers

*   **Remove excess digits:** ADC should have up to three decimal places; greater precision is rare. AUC, ICC, and Kappa values should have 2 digits only (e.g., .82).
*   **Odds ratios, risk ratios, and hazard ratios:** *Radiology* follows the AMA Manual of Style for rounding of odds ratios, risk ratios, and hazard ratios (19.4.1 Significant Digits). Odds ratios, risk ratios, hazard ratios, and 95% CIs should have significant digits extending to the one hundredths place (e.g., 1.01, 5.26, 9.85, 0.15). Numbers extending beyond the one hundredth place should be rounded.
*   **Correlation coefficients:** Number of digits depends on number of patients (correlation with 24 patients should have 2 digits of correlation; 243 patients could have 3 digits of correlation). Specify if r or r2. If using standard correlation coefficients, then express as r2.
*   **Percentages:** Number of digits: The number of digits in a percentage should correspond to the number of digits in the X/Y values of the proportion. Be consistent for similar data. Generally, a minimum of 2 digits should be shown. 22 of 50 = 44% and not 44.0%.
*   **Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, NPV, PPV:** Use percentages and avoid decimals. E.g., Sensitivity 85% rather than sensitivity 0.85.
*   **P-values:** Adjust all P values according to *Radiology* style:
    *   Use two digits for P values (unless providing Bonferroni-corrected P values) (e.g., p=.52; p=.04).
    *   If P value < .01, then use three digits (e.g., p=.005).
    *   For values close to .05, you may provide a third digit (i.e., .046).
    *   Give exact P value unless < .001.
    *   Smallest P value should be <.001, largest >.99.
    *   Do not include leading zeros for P values.
    *   Avoid scientific notation (e.g., p = 5×10-3 should be p=.005; p = 5×10-5 should be p<.001; p = 6.2×10-2 should be p=.06).

Authors will be asked to complete an ICMJE conflict of interest disclosure form before the final acceptance of the manuscript.

### Instructions for Submission of Revised Manuscripts

When you prepare a revised version of your manuscript, it is essential that you carefully follow the instructions given in the Editor’s letter. If there are discrepancies between what is below and what is in the decision letter, follow the instructions in the letter. Use the standard uploading format (as described for original submissions), but include both a clean copy of your manuscript and an annotated copy describing the changes you have made. Make sure to select the appropriate file designations for these two versions (Main Body and Annotated Main Body). Failure to do so will cause a delay in the review of your revision. Note that both the Main Body and Annotated Main Body will be sent to reviewers should your manuscript be sent for re-review. Both versions need to be anonymized. Failure to do so may cause reviewers to know your identity. Anonymize any identifying information such as author names, titles, initials, and institutions. Also, If citing your work, avoid the first person (we previously demonstrated). Instead, use the third person (Smith et al have demonstrated). Instructions on changing your displayed name in comments and tracked changes can be found here. Change the name you display to Author. Do not use your real name.

If references, tables, or figures are moved, added, or deleted during the revision process, renumber them to reflect such changes so that all tables, references and figures are cited in numeric order. Upload individual high resolution figures files at revision.

*   **Creating a Revision:** If you wish to submit a revision of your manuscript, click on the Create a Revision link in the Manuscripts with Decisions list.
*   **Forms:** If the Author Contribution Form and the Transfer of Copyright and Certifications Agreement are not completed at the time of revision, processing of the revision will be held until all forms are complete.
*   **Revised Manuscript: What to Submit:**
    *   **Clean Version:** If references, tables, or figures are moved, added, or deleted during the revision process, please renumber them to reflect such changes so that all tables, references and figures are cited in numerical order.
    *   **Annotated Version:** The annotated copy should have highlights on the changes (either by using Track Changes function in Microsoft Word or by highlighting or underlining text) with notes in the text referring to the Editor or reviewer query (for example, highlighted text [R2.2] would be the second comment from reviewer 2, and highlighted text [E1.4] would be the fourth comment from the Editor). Be sure when you upload your annotated version that the changes are clearly visible on the PDF file prior to resubmission. The annotated version of your manuscript will be sent to reviewers should your manuscript be sent for re-review. It should be anonymized.
    *   **Figures:** For revisions, production quality figures should be uploaded individually, not in a combined document. Number and label figures consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the manuscript. Ensure that the file name contains the figure number. When uploading image files, insert the figure legend into the caption box.
    *   **Point-by-Point Response letter:** A point-by-point response letter is required specifying how each of the Editor and reviewer comments have been addressed.
    *   **Confirmation of sole submission to *Radiology***: At the time of submitting a revision, questions regarding overlapping content are again asked. The submission by authors of similar material to advertising, news media, or other forms of publication must be indicated at the time *Radiology* receives the revised manuscript, and a copy of that material should be provided with the submission.

### Manuscript Transfer between RSNA Journals

RSNA has a suite of journals. Papers submitted to *Radiology* but not accepted for publication may, in some cases, be eligible for publication in another of these journals. If your manuscript is rejected from *Radiology*, we would be happy to transfer your submission to the second journal. Editors at the second journal may use the information gathered during evaluation at *Radiology* to expedite review, including reuse of the reviews, provided reviewers agree. If your manuscript underwent peer review at *Radiology*, you may either edit your manuscript based on the reviewer recommendations or submit as is. If you make edits, please include a document explaining the changes made as well as a document with tracked changes. The editors at the second journal will review the manuscript, along with the comments from the *Radiology* reviewers, and will let you know what additional changes need to be made in a revised version.

The Editors may include an invitation to transfer in your decision letter. If you accept the transfer, you will be able to select any *Radiology* suite journal for transfer. Please note that some journals may not be suitable for your manuscript based on the scope of the particular journal and the content of the manuscript. If you choose to transfer, documents that were part of the review process at *Radiology* will be transferred to your Author Center at the second journal. Although the suggestion for manuscript transfer indicates interest in the manuscript, there is no guarantee that the transferred manuscript will be accepted. Manuscript transfers between RSNA journals are intended to ease the submission process and are entirely at the author’s discretion.

### Fast Track Pre-submission Program

*Radiology* is soliciting practice-changing image-related manuscripts that have undergone peer review by highly regarded medical/science journals (such as *NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, Nature, Science*) but were not accepted for publication. These image-focused papers may be better suited for a medical imaging journal such as *Radiology*. We are particularly interested in clinical trials and registries. We offer a new pathway for selected manuscripts to undergo accelerated review and decision. The editorial board will take into consideration the prior peer reviews.

Authors interested in this new accelerated program should submit:

1.  A cover letter summarizing the manuscript and explaining its suitability for the Fast Track Pre-submission Program. Specify how the authors revised the manuscript to address the prior journal’s concerns.
2.  A copy of the decision letter issued by the prior journal.
3.  A copy of the reviews you received from the prior journal.
4.  All authors are responsible for any submitted materials. The authors should assert that the content provided in points 2 and 3 is accurate, complete, and has not been altered.
5.  Submit clean and annotated versions of the revised manuscript to address the reviewer comments. No reformatting is necessary for consideration for Fast Track Pre-Submission.
6.  For reviewer comments, provide specific point-by-point response to any editor and reviewer comments. Indicate whether you have addressed the previous reviews, and provide a rationale if not.

Upon receipt of the above material, the editorial board of *Radiology* will promptly evaluate the documents to assess whether the manuscript is appropriate for the scope of *Radiology* and this rapid review process. We aim to offer an expedited review by utilizing the prior reviews in our manuscript evaluation. We will send you our decision within 7 days of submission. *Radiology* may decide that additional peer reviews are necessary before issuing a final decision.

This Fast Track Pre-submission Program is developed to streamline the review and publication of practice-changing research. To participate in this program, the corresponding author should submit these documents to radiology@rsna.org.

# *Radiology* Scientific Style Guide: Original Article Manuscript Preparation

This document consolidates the stylistic guidelines for preparing an Original Article manuscript for submission to *Radiology*, aiming for clarity, conciseness, and completeness.

## 1. Manuscript Type & General Requirements

*   **Manuscript Type:** Focus on **Original Research** (word limit: 3000 words). Technical Developments (2000 words) follow a similar structure but with more limited Introduction and Discussion sections.
*   **Supplemental Material:** Online-only publication of supplemental material is available but will not be copyedited.
*   **General:** Refer to the official *Radiology* author instructions for other manuscript types.

## 2. Title

*   **Word Limit:** Maximum 15 words.
*   **Content:** Include the *modality* (for which body part), *disease*, and/or problem being studied.
*   **Conciseness:** Be concise.
*   **Optional:** If space allows, indicate study type (e.g., randomized clinical trial) and clinical trial or cohort name (e.g., DETERMINE, MESA).

## 3. Abbreviations

*   **List Limit:** Include a list of up to 10 standard abbreviations.
*   **Usage Frequency:** Each abbreviation in the list must appear at least ten times in the paper (from Introduction to Discussion). Otherwise, write them out and do not include them in the list.
*   **First Mention:** Define all abbreviations/acronyms at first mention in *both* the Abstract and the main text.
*   **Common Modalities:** Do not define common imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, US, SPECT, PET).
*   **Adjusted Values:** Do not abbreviate adjusted values (e.g., aOR for adjusted odds ratio). Instead, write out the context, such as: "In the adjusted model, the OR was XX; after multivariable adjustment, the OR was XX."
*   **Key Sections:** Define/write out abbreviations in the Summary, Key Results, and the first and last paragraphs of the Discussion, as readers often look to these areas for a synopsis.

*   **Visual Abstracts:** Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts.

## 6. Abstract (300 words)

The abstract is the public "face" of your article and is crucial for initial evaluation. Be concise, specific, and avoid jargon.

### 6.1. Background

*   **Length:** One or two sentences (at most).
*   **Content:** State why the study was performed and/or why it is relevant. Frame it from a clinical radiologist's perspective (e.g., "Why is this study important to my radiology practice?").

### 6.2. Purpose

*   **Content:** Describe the research question you are trying to answer. This should be a brief, precise statement, essentially the same as your aim at the end of your main introduction.
*   **Consistency:** The purpose must fit your conclusion (e.g., if comparing diagnostic performance, do not mention survival outcomes in the conclusion).

### 6.3. Materials and Methods

*   **Study Type:** Name the study as retrospective, prospective, secondary analysis of a prospective trial, or randomized controlled trial in the first sentence.
    *   **Prospective Study:** Data collection planned before index test and reference standard. Participants enrolled with consent, data analysis, and outcomes specified beforehand. Patients are referred to as *participants*.
    *   **Secondary Analysis:** If the main prospective study did not include your study purpose in its original design.
    *   **Retrospective Study:** Examines exposures to suspected risk or protection factors related to an outcome established at the start of the study, using existing medical data. Patients are referred to as *patients*.
*   **Registered Studies:** For registered studies, provide the registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567).
*   **Participants:**
    *   For animal studies, provide type and number.
    *   For human studies, the number, sex ratios, and ages go in the Results section.
    *   Specify the disease and groups compared (e.g., women with and without breast cancer).
*   **Study Dates:** Provide beginning and end dates of the study or participant accrual and follow-up (e.g., July 2019 to June 2020). Recent dates are preferred. Clearly state the length of any follow-up period(s).
*   **Multicenter Studies:** Emphasize multicenter studies by stating the number and type of institutions involved (e.g., tertiary care center, academic medical center).
*   **Reference Standard & Index Test:** Clearly state what the reference standard (best test currently available) and the index test (the test being evaluated) are.
*   **Modalities/Procedures:** Describe the modalities and procedures performed.
*   **Outcomes:** Describe pre-specified primary outcome measure(s), as well as secondary and other variables, interventions being compared, and treatment/control groups.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Provide a sentence on statistical analysis, summarizing the tests performed and descriptive statistics. Key statistical terms like "multivariable," "adjusted," or "independent/control variables" can make your study stand out.

### 6.4. Results

*   **First Sentence:** Indicate the number, sex, and mean age $\pm$ standard deviation (SD) or median age and interquartile range (IQR) of the patients/participants enrolled. Example: "100 patients (mean age, 47 years $\pm$ 10 [standard deviation], 60 men) were evaluated." Provide the sex of the larger number of patients.
*   **Data Presentation:**
    *   Provide numerical data and P-values for all comparisons (e.g., group A, 25 $\pm$ 4, group B 50 $\pm$ 5, p=.01).
    *   Include confidence intervals if appropriate (e.g., AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
    *   Include numerator and denominator for percentages (e.g., sensitivity 20 of 25 (80%)).
    *   Focus on about three main results. Avoid obscuring key results with too many numbers. The results should be interpretable on their own without reference to the main paper. Provide labels and units for all numbers.

### 6.5. Conclusion

*   **Content:** Must correspond to the purpose statement and derive directly from the results.
*   **Avoid Elaboration:** Do not elaborate on the importance of the study or other implications.

## 7. Introduction (400 words)

### 7.1. Claims of Priority

*   **Wording:** If you must indicate novelty, use the phrase: "the finding of [whatever the finding is] has not previously been well established in the literature."
*   **Study Size:** If discussing study size, do not refer to your study as "the largest study to date." Instead, write: "large studies have not yet been performed on [whatever topic]."
*   **Frequency:** Only state these claims once in the introduction.

### 7.2. Hypotheses

*   **Applicability:** Only for prospective studies.
*   **Placement:** At the end of the introduction, mention any prespecified hypotheses before your purpose/aim.

Reference all studies published or in press. Also, explain if there was a different analysis of data. If too many to reference, include a supplemental table.

### 8.5. Definitions of Key Terms

*   Consider including a separate section titled *Definitions of Terms*. This will also make your study more understandable to general radiologists. Move any long equations to the supplement for ease of reading.

### 8.6. Imaging Protocols

*   **Detail:** Be brief but include enough detail that the imaging could be repeated for the key sequences.
*   **MRI:** Include repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). If more detail is needed, the full pulse sequence is likely better placed in an online supplement.
*   **CT:** Indicate contrast or non-contrast, plane, section thickness, and section interval.

### 8.7. Product Name and Manufacturer

*   **First Mention:** When first mentioned, identify any used instruments or drugs (including contrast) with brand/trade names and manufacturer’s name in parentheses.
*   **Subsequent Use:** Thereafter, use generic terms if information can be accurately conveyed. Data presentation should be unbiased and not promotional. If multiple brands of systems (e.g., MRI, CT) are used in the article, a table is suggested.

### 8.8. Diagnostic Accuracy Studies: Reference Standard and Index Test

*   **Clarity:** Clearly state your reference standard (the best method currently available to establish the presence or absence of a target condition) and index test (the procedure or test whose accuracy is being evaluated).
*   **Independence:** The index test and reference standard should be independent of each other.

### 8.9. Investigators and Readers/Evaluations

*   **Expertise:** Provide the number of readers and/or investigators, along with their expertise, and years of experience (for residents, indicate "in-training").
*   **Initials:** Provide initials for any authors. If those contributors are not authors, mention them in the Acknowledgments but obtain written permission. Nonauthor contributor initials should not appear in the text of the article.
*   **Software:** State if using automated or semiautomated software to analyze or complete postprocessing of images; provide software name, version, and manufacturer.
*   **Reading Process:** State if studies were read independently, if readings were randomly assigned, the use of any consensus agreements, and how disagreements, if any, were resolved.
*   **Variability:** For one/multiple readers, indicate how intra- or inter-reader variability was measured (e.g., $\kappa$ statistic, intraclass correlation coefficient) and how coefficients were interpreted (e.g., cutoff values for weak, moderate, strong). Note that single observer studies are discouraged, as are "consensus" reads.
*   **Blinding:** Mention anonymizing of data or images. Clearly state what readers were anonymized to, and what they were not anonymized to.
*   **Time Interval:** Provide the time interval between readout sessions to eliminate recall bias.

### 8.10. Subgroup Analysis

*   **Specification:** Mention if subgroup analysis was pre-specified (required for randomized controlled clinical trials) or post-hoc.
*   **Post-hoc:** If using a post-hoc analysis, address it in methods and include it as a limitation in the discussion.

### 8.11. Statistical Analysis

The last paragraph(s) of Materials and Methods should be titled *Statistical Analysis*.
*   **Tests:** State the statistical tests used, on what data, and for what determinations.
*   **P-value:** Provide the P-value used for significance (e.g., $P<.05$). For multiple comparisons, mention Bonferroni correction if applicable.
*   **Software:** Indicate statistical software used, including version and manufacturer.
*   **Analyst:** If the statistical analyst is an author, provide their initials.
*   **Sample Size/Power:** A statement of justification of sample size and/or power calculation is strongly recommended, especially in studies where the primary conclusion is of nonsignificance. Briefly mention power, significance, statistical test, and magnitude of effect.
*   **Metrics:** Avoid net reclassification index and integrated discrimination index for inferences regarding a new radiology imaging test being better than an old test. Traditional AUC analysis or change in standard metrics (e.g., test positivity rate) is sufficient. AUC is preferred to C-index.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Use standard measures (e.g., percentages, means $\pm$ SDs; medians and IQRs).
*   **Inferential Statistics:** Include 95% CIs to indicate the range of likely values for key measures (required for AUC values, sensitivity, specificity, and for differences/effects in comparative studies).
*   **Multivariable Analysis:** Mention univariable and/or multivariable analysis. For multivariable analysis, distinguish between confounding variables you adjusted for (e.g., age, sex) and independent variables being investigated. Mention summary measures such as regression coefficients, correlations, odds ratios, and hazard ratios. If calculating hazard or odds ratios, mention reference categories.
*   **Matched Data:** Provide appropriate analysis for matched data.

## 9. Registered Studies and Data Sharing Statement

*   **Registry Information:** If your study is registered on a national or international database (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO clinical trials registry platform), provide the registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567) at the end of the Abstract and again in Materials & Methods.

    *   Report the numerator and denominator for percentages: sensitivity 20 of 25 (80%).
    *   Include confidence intervals: (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
*   **"Significant" Terminology:**
    *   Define the level of statistical significance (e.g., p < .05) in your Methods, statistical analysis section.
    *   Thereafter, minimize repeating "significant" or "significantly." Simply state the p-value.
    *   Use "significant" only in the statistical sense. Delete unless referring to something being *clinically significant* or having *clinical significance*, using that exact wording.
*   **Nonsignificant Results:** Do not write "There was no difference between groups A and B." Write "We found no evidence of a difference between groups A and B."

### 12.1. Discussion Structure

*   **Paragraph 1 (Summary):** Provide a succinct 1-paragraph summary of the entire study. Briefly restate the background (why the study was done). Then state the major findings. Instead of providing general statements that something was better or superior, provide specific metrics with data and p-values (key results).

*   Do not include any results not mentioned in the Results section. If you wish to include them in the Discussion, they must also be presented in the Results section with appropriate information in Materials and Methods (what was done, by whom, etc.).

## 13. References

*   **Limit:** Reference limit is 35 for original research. This limit is not applicable to meta-analyses.
*   **Personal Communication:** Avoid citations of personal communication.
*   **"Recent" References:** Do not refer to a reference as "recent" unless it is a newer study ($\le$5 years old).

## 14. Figures

*   **Numbering:** Number all figures in the order they first appear in the text.
*   **Captions:** For each figure, define all abbreviations in the caption and include all units. Each figure must be understood on its own.
*   **Graphs:** Each graph needs labels and units for x and and y axes. Do not use graph abbreviations unless full terms cannot fit on the axes.
*   **Color:** Include a labeled color bar for figures that use color.
*   **Histology:** For histologic sections, provide the stain used and the magnification.
*   **Labeling:** Label all features you describe in the captions. Review recently published articles in *Radiology* for the required degree of labeling.
*   **Arrowheads:** Avoid using equilateral triangles for arrowheads (difficult to determine labeling point).
*   **MRI:** For all MRI, include the specific pulse sequence information (e.g., TR, TE, etc.) in the caption if not described (or different) from that described in methods.
*   **Kaplan Meier Curves:** Add the censored data points and the number at risk below the graph.
*   **Box Plunger Plots:** Avoid box plunger plots. Present data as a box whisker plot or show actual data points in a box plot.
*   **Clinical Images:** Provide at least one or two actual scan images that demonstrate your main findings.
*   **Individual Patient/Participant Figures:** Include a separate figure for each individual patient/participant. Figure legends should include age, sex, clinical history/disease, type of image (e.g., CT, MRI, US), plane, and other relevant details such as whether contrast was used or not. Use present tense.

## 15. Tables

*   **Numbering:** Number all tables in the order they first appear in the text.
*   **Size:** Fit each table on one page. Limit main tables to no more than 40 rows and 6-8 columns.
*   **Headings:** Every column must have a heading and follow the same heading all the way down. Each row must follow the same heading all the way across.
*   **Variables:** Use rows for independent (X) variables, columns for dependent (Y) variables.
*   **Footnotes:** For each table, define all abbreviations and data values in a footnote and include all units of measure, if not already included. Each table must be understood on its own.
*   **Table 1: Demographic Characteristics of Study Sample:**
    *   For manuscripts with human participants, include a table of demographic characteristics.
    *   Minimum information: number and sex of participants, mean age $\pm$ SD or median age IQR, age range, and key clinical characteristics.
    *   Provide relevant covariates needed to describe participants (e.g., women: pre/postmenopausal status; cardiovascular disease: diabetes status, smoking.).
    *   If biologically reasonable and a large study, provide mean age $\pm$ SD or median age and IQR separately for men and women, in addition to giving the same information for all individuals as one group. Also, report any statistically significant differences in age between men and women.
*   **Multivariable Analysis Tables:**
    *   Include key parameters: regression coefficients, odds or hazard ratios with confidence intervals, and p-values.
    *   Include the number of events (n = \_\_).
    *   Indicate the number of participants dropped out due to missing data.

## 16. Common Issues & Terminology

*   **Area Under the ROC Curve:** Abbreviate as AUC, not AUROC.
*   **Biomarker:** Avoid overuse of the term "biomarker."
*   **CT Density:** Change "density" (for CT) to *attenuation*.
*   **Regression Terms:** Change "multivariate/univariate" to *multivariable/univariable*. A multivariable regression equation has multiple x variables and a single y (dependent) variable. If multiple Y variables in one equation, then multivariate may be (rarely) appropriate.
*   **Incomplete Reporting of Results:** Always report p-values with corresponding comparison values (e.g., group A, 25 $\pm$ 4, group B 50 $\pm$ 5, p=.01). Provide both numerical data and p-values for all comparisons.
*   **Accuracy vs. Performance:** AUC measures the *performance* of a model. Refer to "diagnostic performance" for AUC. Refer to "accuracy" when referring to accuracy percentage (fraction of predictions model got right).
*   **"Cases":** Limit the term "cases" when you could use a more specific word (e.g., *patients, participants, lesions*).
*   **Define All Terms:** Define all terms at first use. "Conventional" and "high resolution" MRI are vague; be specific (e.g., high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution). Terms such as "Ultra high resolution/Low dose/Ultra low dose" should be used sparingly and defined in Methods.
*   **"Correlated":** Use "correlated" only in the statistical sense and provide the correlation coefficient. Otherwise, use another appropriate word (e.g., associated, compared).
*   **Study Sample vs. Study Cohort vs. Population:**
    *   **Study sample:** A subset of the population.
    *   **Population:** The wide-ranging group of people to whom you aim to generalize the study results.
    *   **Study cohort:** Only appropriate for a longitudinal study that samples and observes a cohort over a period of time.

## 17. How to Present Numbers

*   **Excess Digits:** Remove excess digits.
    *   ADC should have up to three decimal places; greater precision is rare.
    *   AUC, ICC, and Kappa values should have 2 digits only (e.g., .82).
*   **Odds Ratios, Risk Ratios, Hazard Ratios:** Significant digits extending to the one hundredths place (e.g., 1.01, 5.26, 9.85, 0.15). Numbers extending beyond should be rounded.
*   **Correlation Coefficients:** Number of digits depends on the number of patients (e.g., correlation with 24 patients should have 2 digits of correlation; 243 patients could have 3 digits of correlation). Specify if r or r$^2$. If using standard correlation coefficients, then express as r$^2$.
*   **Percentages:** The number of digits in a percentage should correspond to the number of digits in the X/Y values of the proportion. Be consistent for similar data. Generally, a minimum of 2 digits should be shown (e.g., 22 of 50 = 44%, not 44.0%).
*   **Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, NPV, PPV:** Use percentages and avoid decimals (e.g., Sensitivity 85% rather than sensitivity 0.85).
*   **P-values:** Adjust all P values according to *Radiology* style:
    *   Use two digits for P values (unless providing Bonferroni-corrected P values) (e.g., p=.52; p=.04).
    *   If P value < .01, then use three digits (e.g., p=.005).
    *   For values close to .05, you may provide a third digit (i.e., .046).
    *   Give the exact P value unless < .001.
    *   Smallest P value should be <.001, largest >.99.
    *   Do not include leading zeros for P values.
    *   Avoid scientific notation:
        *   p = 5$\times$10$^{-3}$ should be p=.005
        *   p = 5$\times$10$^{-5}$ (0.00005) should be p<.001
        *   p = 6.2$\times$10$^{-2}$ (0.062) should be p=.06
