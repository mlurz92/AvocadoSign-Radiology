            <p>Accurate preoperative determination of mesorectal lymph node status (N-status) is a cornerstone of modern rectal cancer management, directly influencing decisions between primary surgery, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), and organ-preserving strategies ${helpers.getReference('Sauer_2004')}${helpers.getReference('Habr_Gama_2019')}. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the established modality for local staging, its reliability in N-staging remains a significant clinical challenge. The standard approach, relying on T2-weighted (T2w) morphological criteria such as node size, border contour, and internal signal characteristics, has demonstrated inconsistent and often suboptimal diagnostic accuracy ${helpers.getReference('Beets_Tan_2018')}.</p>
            <p>This limitation is well-documented in the literature. A pivotal meta-analysis by Al-Sukhni et al. reported pooled sensitivity and specificity of only 77% and 71%, respectively, for T2w MRI in detecting nodal metastases ${helpers.getReference('Al_Sukhni_2012')}. More recent investigations have confirmed these challenges; for instance, a prospective validation of the 2016 ESGAR consensus criteria revealed a sensitivity of just 54%, underscoring the persistent difficulty in reliably identifying involved nodes based on morphology alone ${helpers.getReference('Rutegard_2025')}. This diagnostic uncertainty can lead to both over- and undertreatment, highlighting a critical need for more robust and reproducible imaging markers. While advanced techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging have been explored, they have not yet consistently surpassed morphological assessment in routine clinical practice ${helpers.getReference('Hao_2025')}.</p>
            <p>Our group previously described the "Avocado Sign," a simple binary feature identified on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, defined as a hypointense core within a homogeneously enhancing lymph node ${helpers.getReference('Lurz_Schaefer_2025')}. While our initial work established the standalone performance of the Avocado Sign, a direct and rigorous comparison against the spectrum of T2w criteria—from established literature guidelines to a data-driven, cohort-optimized 'best-case' scenario—has not yet been performed on the same patient cohort. Such a comparison is essential to validate its clinical utility and position it relative to the current standard of care.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign for predicting mesorectal lymph node involvement and to compare it with both established literature-based and cohort-optimized T2-weighted morphological criteria sets.</p>
