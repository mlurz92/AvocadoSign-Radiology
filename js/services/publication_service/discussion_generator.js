            <p>In this retrospective analysis of a previously described patient cohort, we performed a new, blinded re-evaluation to rigorously compare the diagnostic performance of the contrast-enhanced Avocado Sign against multiple T2-weighted morphological criteria for predicting mesorectal lymph node status. Our central finding is that the Avocado Sign, a simple binary imaging marker, provides high diagnostic accuracy that is superior to established, literature-based T2w criteria. Furthermore, its performance was not inferior to a cohort-optimized T2w criteria set derived from a brute-force analysis (${bfComparisonText}), which represents a data-driven 'best-case' scenario for conventional morphology in our specific cohort.</p>

            <p>The limitations of conventional T2w criteria are well-documented, with prior meta-analyses reporting suboptimal pooled sensitivity and specificity ${helpers.getReference('Al_Sukhni_2012')}. Our results align with these findings, showing that established literature-based criteria, such as the ESGAR consensus guidelines, performed with lower sensitivity in our cohort ${helpers.getReference('Rutegard_2025')}. The Avocado Sign may derive its robustness from being a functional, perfusion-based marker rather than a purely morphological one. This could make it less susceptible to the known confounders of T2w imaging, such as reactive inflammatory changes or post-treatment fibrosis, which can alter node size and signal characteristics without necessarily indicating malignancy. This is further supported by our finding that the sign's performance was stable across different treatment settings. ${interCohortComparisonText}</p>
            <p>The straightforward, binary nature of the Avocado Sign is another key advantage. It obviates the need for complex, multi-feature assessments and subjective size measurements, which can be a source of inter-reader variability. This is reflected in its previously reported almost perfect interobserver agreement (Cohenâ€™s kappa = ${helpers.formatValueForPublication(overallStats?.interobserverKappa, 2, false, true)}) ${helpers.getReference('Lurz_Schaefer_2025')}, suggesting that the sign can be reliably assessed by radiologists with varying levels of expertise. Its straightforward application, requiring only routine high-resolution, fat-saturated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, makes it easily incorporable into standard MRI protocols.</p>

        const limitationsParagraph = `
            <p>This study had several limitations. First, its retrospective, single-center design may limit the generalizability of our findings, and selection bias cannot be entirely ruled out. Second, all MRI examinations were performed on a single 3.0-T MRI system using one type of macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gadoteridol); thus, performance with other agents or at different field strengths is unknown. Third, our analysis was performed on a per-patient basis rather than a node-by-node correlation, which is challenging after neoadjuvant therapy and of debated clinical utility. Fourth, the cohort-optimized T2w criteria set was identified through a brute-force analysis on our specific dataset. By its nature, this method is prone to overfitting, and the resulting criteria represent a data-driven 'best-case' scenario for this cohort, which may not generalize to other populations without further validation. Finally, this analysis did not include extramesorectal nodes or assess long-term oncologic outcomes, which warrants future research.</p>

        const conclusionParagraph = `
            <p>In conclusion, the Avocado Sign is an accurate and reproducible imaging marker for the prediction of mesorectal lymph node involvement in rectal cancer. Its performance is superior to established literature-based T2w criteria and comparable to a computationally optimized set of T2w criteria, suggesting it could simplify and standardize nodal assessment. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted to confirm these findings and establish the role of the Avocado Sign in routine clinical practice, particularly for patient stratification in advanced treatment paradigms like total neoadjuvant therapy and nonoperative management.</p>
