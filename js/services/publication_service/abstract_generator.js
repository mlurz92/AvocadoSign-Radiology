                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Accurate preoperative determination of mesorectal lymph node status is crucial for treatment decisions in rectal cancer, yet standard T2-weighted (T2w) MRI criteria have shown limited diagnostic accuracy.</p>
                
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign, a novel contrast-enhanced MRI marker, and to compare it with both established literature-based and cohort-optimized T2w morphological criteria for predicting N-status.</p>
                
                <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
                <p>This retrospective, single-center study received institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent. Data from ${nOverall} consecutive patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer who underwent 3.0-T MRI between January 2020 and November 2023 were analyzed. Two blinded radiologists evaluated the Avocado Sign on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and methods were compared using the DeLong test.</p>
